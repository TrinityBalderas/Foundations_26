Design

What does design mean to you?

How something is constructed -- in appearance
Making things pretty and organized
Plan a process
A blueprint


Important questions:

Is the site accessible?
How is the user experience?
Does the website seem trustworthy?
Is it attractive?



User Experience

How does the user feel when using your site/app?
The goal -- Easy to use, positive and meaningful experience

"In large part, what makes something usable is the absence of frustration in using it"
-- Dana Chisnell, Harvard Author, User Experience researcher

--Communicate the process
--Provide feedback
--Hide non-critical features
--Interactivity is self evident

Consistency, white space, lack of clutter

Misconceptions:
It's just a step in the process
It's easy
It's not -your- job
It's optional

Principles of Visual Design (What the user sees):

--Contrast
--Repetition
--Alignment
--Proximity


Grids and Spacing

--Columns make up the proportions of the website.
--Bringing order to your elements

Negative space around columns are called gutters or whitespace.
--Remain consistent
--Gets rid of clutter
--Differentiate between sections

Color Harmony
--harmonized colors deliver a sense of balance and order
--makes the difference between obnoxious, and beautiful

Photos
--Images create visual interest

Typography
--Visual hierarchy
--Brings attention to key elements
--Basic fonts are the standard
--No more than 2 font families, consistency matters

Go Big
--Large elements draw attention



Prototyping

low-fidelity (low-fi)
--sketch, wireframes
--simple overview, basic structure

high-fidelity (hi-fi)
--feels like the real app
--attention to details

Why prototype?
--Test out usability
--Setup before you code

--low-fi sketches happen quick, and cheap, don't overthink
--low-fi sketches communicate the general idea/message

--high-fi sketches should happen reasonably quick
--high-fi sketches look like the real thing
